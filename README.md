# MATLAB Project

##  Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB Live Script (`Project.mlx`) along with supporting audio and image files that illustrate signal processing and image processing concepts. It includes steps for preprocessing, filtering, spectrogram generation, and computing Bit Error Rate (BER) with associated Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis.

##  Contents
- `Project.mlx` – Interactive MATLAB Live Script detailing the project workflow and results.
- `Project_REPORT.pdf` – A comprehensive report summarizing methodology, observations, and conclusions.
- Image files (visual results and intermediate stages):
  - `Original Audio Signal.png`
  - `Preprocessed Audio Signal.png`
  - `Filtered Received Audio Signal.png`
  - `Received Audio Signal.png`
  - `Spectrogram of Received Audio Signal.png`
  - `Bit Error rate & SNR value.png`
- Course-related references (optional for context or learning):
  - `Image_Processing_Onramp.pdf`
  - `Signal_Processing_Onramp.pdf`
  - `Wireless_Communications_Onramp.pdf`
  - `Matlab Onramp.png`

##  How to Use
1. **Open** `Project.mlx` in MATLAB to interact with the code and get real-time visual results.
2. **Review** `Project_REPORT.pdf` for a detailed interpretation of each step and outcome.
3. **Inspect** the included images to observe the visual evolution of the signal and image processing stages.

##  Key Highlights
- **Audio preprocessing** and filtering to enhance signal quality.
- **Spectrogram visualization** to analyze frequency components.
- **BER vs. SNR calculation**, which is pivotal in assessing communication system performance.

##  Requirements
- MATLAB (version supporting `.mlx` Live Scripts).
- Optional: Signal Processing Toolbox for advanced filtering functions.
